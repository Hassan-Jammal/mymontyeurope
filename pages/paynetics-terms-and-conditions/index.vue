                        <li>If a payment using a Card is in a currency other than the currency of the Account, then the amount deducted will be the amount of the Card payment converted to the currency of the Account using the reference exchange rate applied by MasterCardÂ® (available at <u>Mastercard Currency Converter | Currency Exchange Rate Calculator </u>) plus the currency conversion mark-up fee set out in the Tariff for Card payments. The exchange rate shall be determined on the date on which the Card payment is processed. The exchange rate is not set by Paynetics and varies throughout the day meaning it may change between the date the Card payment is made and the date it is processed. Paynetics provides information on the total currency conversion charges applicable with respect to Card payments, expressed as a percentage mark-up over the latest available euro foreign exchange reference rates issued by the European Central Bank on the Website.</li>

                        <li>We will, if possible, notify you before restricting, blocking or deactivating your Account or Card that we will do so and the reasons for it.

                        <li>We work with Monty Finance UK Ltd. (the " <strong>Partner </strong>") when providing you with the services. The Partner is a company incorporated in England &amp; Wales with company number 13458623 and registered address at Bridge House, 181 Queen Victoria Street, London, United Kingdom, EC4V 4EG .</li>
                        <li>The Partner introduced you to us, so that we might provide you with our services. In addition, the Partner runs the Customer Relations Centre and assists us in handling any complaints that you have about our services.</li>
                        <li>The Partner operates the mobile application platform further described in clause 9 (the " <strong>Platform </strong>") which is published in the Apple AppStore and Google Play Store, and which connects you to Paynetics and enables you to access your Cards and your Account in relation to our services. The Account, the Cards and the Platform will have the Partner's branding on it. However, it is important for you to know that the Partner does not provide you with any payment services.

                    <h2 class="font-AeonikBlack text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl 4xl:text-4xl uppercase mt-4">5. INFORMATION ON YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Your Account is an electronic money account within which you can hold electronic money. Your GBP Account can hold electronic money in GBP and your Euro Account can hold electronic money in Euro.</li>
                        <li>Electronic money is an electronic alternative to money. When you send money to your Account, we will credit the relevant Account with a corresponding amount of electronic money. In these terms, when we refer to 'money' in your Account, what we mean is electronic money.</li>
                        <li>Once you have money in your Account, you will be able to use our services.</li>
                        <li>Your Account differs from bank accounts in that money in your Account:
                            <ol>
                                <li>will not be invested or lent to third parties;</li>
                                <li>will not accrue interest; and</li>
                                <li>will not be covered by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <p>Money in your Account will be safeguarded, as explained in Clause 7.</p>
                        <li>You can credit your GBP Account by making a payment via bank transfer using the details of the sort code and account number linked to your GBP Account as the beneficiary account details.</li>
                        <li>You can credit your Euro Account by making a payment via bank transfer using the details of the IBAN linked to your Euro Account as the beneficiary account details.</li>
                        <li>If you send money to the wrong account by mistake when trying to credit your Account, you should contact the financial institution from which you sent money to us. We cannot accept responsibility for sending money by mistake using the services of other financial institutions.</li>
                        <li>Please note that someone other than you can credit your Account by making a payment via bank transfer using the details of:
                            <ol>
                                <li>the account number and sort code linked to your GBP Account as the beneficiary account details (for top ups of your GBP Account);</li>
                                <li>the IBAN linked to your Euro Account as the beneficiary account details (for top ups of your Euro Account ); or</li>

                        <li>We will deduct money from your Account when you execute a Card Payment, a Cash Withdrawal Ð¾ r a Push Payment . We will also deduct money from your Account when you owe us fees.</li>
                        <li>You can find out when money has been added to and taken from your Account by checking the Platform .</li>
                        <li>You can send money from your Account to an account you hold with another financial institution by executing a Push Payment and providing your ( non âPaynetics ) account details as the beneficiary account details.</li>
                        <li>We can hold money in your Account indefinitel y . However, if you have not used the money in your Account for more than two years, we shall try and contact you to establish whether you still want to have an Account with us. If we are unable to get in touch with you, we reserve the right to send the money in your Account, less our costs, to the last known ( non-Paynetics ) account we have on file for you. Any money will be converted to the currency this ( non-Paynetics ) account is denominated in, using our standard exchange rate.</li>
                        <li>We may refuse to top-up your Account if:
                            <ol>
                                <li>it would breach a restriction on your Account (please see clause 14 and the Fees Page );</li>

                                <li>the sender has provided incorrect/invalid Account details for payment;</li>
                                <li>Paynetics reasonably believes the payment is fraudulent, illegal or unauthorised or related to a prohibited transaction (please see clause 14.2).</li>

                        </li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>You may choose to allow (and provided you have given them your explicit consent):
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Providers of account information service (i.e. an online service which accesses one or more payment accounts to provide a consolidated view of such accounts) to access information on your Account; and/or</li>
                                    <li>Providers of payment initiation service (i.e. an online service which allows a third party to initiate payments on behalf of the account holder from their account and at their request) to initiate payments (other than Card payments) from your Account.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Only those providers of account information or payment initiation services that are authorised with the Financial Conduct Authority to provide the relevant service in the UK, can be given access to your Account. The Financial Conduct Authority's register (available at <u>https://register.fca.org.uk/ </u>) will tell you whether a provider is authorised in the UK, and we recommend you check it before using their services.</li>
                            <li>We will treat any instruction from such providers of account information or payment initiation services as if it was from you. Some providers may use your Account security details to provide their service. You should always consider the implications of sharing your security information.</li>
                            <li>We can deny providers of account information or payment initiation services access to your Account if we are concerned about unauthorised or fraudulent access. We will notify you of the denial of access and the reasons for it beforehand if possible or otherwise immediately afterwards (unless doing so would compromise our security measures or would be unlawful). The access to your Account may be restored once the reasons for denying the access no longer justify such denial.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <h2 class="font-AeonikBlack text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl 4xl:text-4xl uppercase mt-4">7. HOW WE PROTECT MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT</h2>
                        <p>When we receive money for your Account, we credit the Account with electronic money and we place the equivalent amount of money in segregated bank accounts with mainstream banks.</p>
                        <p>This is commonly known as <strong>safeguarding </strong>.</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Safeguarding means that in the unlikely event that we get into financial difficulties, the money which we safeguard will be protected from the claims of our creditors and it should be returned to you in full, less the costs incurred by insolvency practitioners in distributing the safeguarded funds.</li>
                            <li>Segregated bank accounts are bank accounts which we hold with mainstream banks, and which only hold client money and not our own money.</li>
                            <li>Money will not be safeguarded by us on your behalf, when it is deducted from your Account .</li>
                        </ol>
                    <h2 class="font-AeonikBlack text-lg md:text-xl xl:text-2xl 4xl:text-4xl uppercase mt-4">8. PUSH PAYMENTS</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A Push Payment is us sending money from your Account to:
                            <ol>
                                <li>your non-Paynetics accounts;</li>
                                <li>to an account belonging to someone other than you which can be a Paynetics account or a non-Paynetics account .</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>We use, and make available to you, various methods to execute Push Payments, including SEPA and Faster Payments. We do not guarantee that any particular payment method will be made available to you.</li>
                        <li>When we refer to a " <strong>beneficiary </strong>" in these terms, we mean a person who will receive the money subject to the Push Payment . The beneficiary account is the account, held by the beneficiary, that you want the money to be sent to.</li>
                        <li>You can make a request for a Push Payment to be executed via the Platform or through a payment initiation service provider. You will need to let us know:
                            <ol>
                                <li>the amount and currency of the Push Payment you wish to make;</li>
                                <li>the name of the beneficiary;</li>
                                <li>information about the beneficiary's Paynetics account (you can choose the payment account by entering the mobile phone number of the beneficiary or by scanning the QR Code (a flat, two-dimensional abstract pattern, made from black bars and squares set on a white background, which contains encrypted information) generated by the beneficiary to whose Paynetics` account the amount will be transferred);</li>
                                <li>the reason for the payment; and</li>
                                <li>if the Push Payment is to a non-Paynetics account, the account's BIC and IBAN (for Push Payments from your Euro Account) or sort code and account number (for Push Payments from your GBP Account) and any other information we request from you.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li>The time of receipt of your request for a Push Payment is when we receive it, which will typically be on the same day you make the request, unless you sent a request after 2:30 PM (for Push Payments in Euro) or on a non-business day, in which case they will be considered received on the next business day. If you future date a Push Payment, then we will be deemed to have received your request to execute the Push Payment on the date you want your Push Payment to be executed.</li>
                        <li>For Push Payments from your GBP Account, executed on or after 7 October 2024, where the beneficiary account is located in the UK, we have implemented confirmation of payee for Push Payments from your GBP Account where the beneficiary account is located in the UK. This means that when you provide us with new beneficiary account details, we will check through the confirmation of payee system that the name of the beneficiary you have provided us with matches the name on the account with the sort code and account number you have provided us with. You will be provided with four possible outcomes from the confirmation of payee system:
                            <ol>
                                <li>Yes, the name and account type you supplied matches the details on the account;</li>
                                <li>No, the name is a close match;</li>
                                <li>No, the name doesn't match the name held on the account;</li>
                                <li>Unavailable, it has not been possible to check the name because: timeout, account doesn't exist etc.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <p>You should take extreme caution when placing a request to execute a Push Payment, where the name you have provided us with does not match, exactly or at all, the name on the account with the sort code and account number you have provided us with.</p>
                        <p>You should not take the fact that the name you have provided us with matches the name on the account, with the sort code and account number you have provided us with, as an assurance that you are not the subject of an APP Scam. If you have any concerns that you might be the victim of an APP Scam, you must contact us prior to executing the Push Payment.</p>
                        <p>For the avoidance of doubt, confirmation of payee will not apply for any Push Payments, executed prior to 7 October 2024.</p>
                        <li>We confirm the details of each Push Payment order placed. After a Push Payment order is processed, you will be able to see the confirmation of the Push Payment on the Platform .</li>
                        <li>If you see confirmation of a Push Payment you did not place with us, you must contact us as soon as possible via the Customer Relations Centre .</li>
                        <li>We can refuse requests from you to execute Push Payment . If we do so, we shall, unless it would be unlawful for us to do so, notify you of the refusal and the reasons for that refusal. We will also let you know the procedure for rectifying any factual errors that led to that refusal.</li>
                        <li>If you think that you have provided us with incorrect details, you must contact us via the Customer Relations Centre as soon as possible.</li>
                        <li>You can only execute a Push Payment if you have enough money in the Account . Your request to execute a Push Payment will be rejected if you try to execute a Push Payment but there is not enough money in the Account to cover the amount of the payment and any applicable fees.</li>
                        <li>You may cancel a request to execute a Push Payment, at any time before the end of the business day before the Push Payment is due to be executed, via the Customer Relations Centre .</li>
                        <li><strong>How long will it take for money sent via a Push Payment to reach the beneficiary account? </strong>We are obliged by the Payment Services Regulations 2017 to tell you the maximum amount of time it is allowed to take, for money in your Account to arrive with the beneficiary's bank. In most cases, it will take less time than this. If you want details of the amount of time it is likely to take, please call us.</li>

                        <ol>
                            <li>Card s are issued under the Mastercard brand pursuant to license granted by Mastercard International or under the Visa brand pursuant to license granted by Visa Europe Limited. The Card allows you to make Card Payments with merchants which accept MastercardÂ© or VisaÂ© and enter into Cash Withdrawals at ATMs which accept MastercardÂ© or VisaÂ©.</li>
                            <li>We issue both physical Cards and 'virtual' Cards . A 'virtual' Card is not a physical card, rather you will be provided with the card number, expiry date and security code via the Platform . You can then use these details to make Card Payments with merchants.</li>
                            <li>The value of Card Payments and Cash Withdrawals and all applicable fees will be deducted from the balance of money in the Account linked to the Card you used.</li>
                            <li>You will be responsible for all goods or services purchased with the Card . Any dispute with a merchant about a product or service purchased with the Card will be considered a dispute between you and the merchant and should be addressed directly to that merchant. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for the quality, safety, legality or any other aspect relating to goods or services purchased with the Card and do not provide any warranties regarding such goods or services.</li>
                            <li>We will not be liable if a merchant refuses to accept your Card or if we have refused to execute a Card Payment or Cash Withdrawal whilst acting in accordance with this Agreement .</li>
                            <li>Your Card s cannot be transferred and/or made available to use by anyone but you.</li>
                            <li>Each Card has a validity period within which you may use the Card . If your Card is physical, it will expire on the last day of the month/year indicated on its front. If your Card is virtual, it will expire on the last day of the month/year indicated on the Platform or on the expiry date sent to you by e-mail. All Card Payments and Cash Withdrawals initiated after the expiration or cancellation of the Card will not be authorised or executed.</li>
                            <li>Your physical Card will be sent to you via post within 10 business days of the date your application is accepted. You may have to produce identification to receive your physical Card . You must sign on the signature strip on the reverse side of your physical Card immediately after receiving it. Your virtual Card will be issued via the Platform immediately after your application is approved by us.</li>
                            <li>When you receive the physical Card, it will be inactive. You have to activate the physical Card before using it. The physical Card can be activated via the Platform by following the instructions for activation provided therein. If your Card is virtual, it is active immediately upon issuance and you may start using it without taking any additional actions.</li>
                            <li>You will be required to create your PIN when you request the issuance of your physical Card via the Platform. You can change your PIN at an ATM or via the Platform. You should memorise your PIN and then ensure that any media on which it is recorded is destroyed or at the very least not kept with your physical Card . You have important obligations to keep your security details, such as your PIN, safe.</li>
                            <li>You may request a new physical Card if your existing Card is lost, stolen or destroyed, or upon expiry of your Card's validity. You will be charged a fee for replacing the physical Card (please see our Fees Page ).</li>
                            <li>You can give us an instruction and consent to a Card Payment and a Cash Withdrawal being executed, using your Card, by any one of the following methods:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>in case of Cash Withdrawal from an ATM, by entering a PIN;</li>
                                    <li>in case of Card Payments in-store, by entering a PIN and/or signature on the receipt or by tapping/waving the physical Card (or a device where it is held) over a card reader for contactless payments;</li>
                                    <li>in case of Card Payments online or over the phone, by providing your Card details and any other security information or credentials, when requested.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </li>
                            <li>Your consent for a Card Payment may cover a single payment or a series of recurring payments on the Card (such as where you give your Card details to a merchant to be used for Card Payments in the future) for a set or variable amount. Please be careful when providing your consent.</li>
                            <li>If there is insufficient money in your Account to complete a Card Payment or Cash Withdrawal, including all applicable fees, the relevant transaction will be refused. See clause 20 for more detail on the applicable currency conversion rates and fees.</li>
                            <li>Merchants in certain business sectors (e.g., car rental companies, hotels and other service providers) estimate the amount of the final Card Payment to them and require us to "pre-authorise" or withhold the estimated amount in the Account your Card is linked to. Sometimes, that withheld amount may exceed the final amount spent. In such cases, the initially withheld funds will not be available to you for up to 15 days until the final Card Payment request is received by us or released by the merchant. We may release such amounts only with the merchant's consent.</li>

                                <li>you couldn't have known that your Card was at risk of being misused prior to it being misused;</li>
                                <li>the Push Payment or Card Payment or Cash Withdrawal (as appropriate) happened because someone we are responsible for made a mistake;</li>
                                <li>the Push Payment was made after you told us that someone knew your Password or could gain access to the Platform and if we had acted on this information, this would have prevented your loss;</li>

                                <li>the law required us to make you follow certain security procedures when you instructed us to make the Push Payment via the Platform and we didn't do this.</li>
                            </ol>

For example, we wouldn't make a refund if you gave someone your Password or your Card and they made a Push Payment or a Card Payment or a Cash Withdrawal without you knowing about it;</li>
                                <li>if we can prove to you that the beneficiary's bank received the amount of the Push Payment on time - in this case you or the beneficiary may be able to recover any losses from the beneficiary's bank.</li>

                        </li>

If we subsequently reasonably believe that you were not entitled to the refund, we will have the right to deduct the amount of the refund from any funds on Account you hold with us and reserve the right to recover the value of the refunded payment by any other legal means.</li>
                        <li>If you gave us the wrong beneficiary account details, we will not issue you with a refund, but we will try and trace the money subject to Push Payment for you. We may charge you a reasonable fee for tracing this money.</li>
                        <li>If it takes longer than it should for money to be deposited in the beneficiary account, please let us know and we can make a request to the beneficiary's account provider to treat the Push Payment as if it was made on time.</li>

                    <ol>
                        <li>If we have received a payment for your Account but we have not credited correctly or on time, we will immediately credit your Account with the correct amount including any fees to restore the Account to the position it would have been at if the payment was executed correctly and on time.</li>
                        <li>If we top-up your Account when we shouldn't have done or when this money does not belong to you, (for example someone sent it to you by mistake), we may, where we consider it reasonable to do so, take this money from your Account and return it to the sender.

                        <li>If you authorise a Card Payment without knowing the final amount of the payment (for example, when renting a car or booking a hotel room) and you think that the final amount of the payment is too much, you have the right to ask us to process a refund of such payment provided that all of the following conditions are met:
                            <ol>
                                <li>you have asked for a refund within 8 weeks of the Card Payment;</li>
                                <li>at the time of authorisation to execute the Card Payment, the exact amount of the Card Payment was not specified; and</li>
                                <li>the amount of the Card Payment exceeded the amount you could have reasonably expected, taking into account your previous spending patterns and the case-specific circumstances. If the amount of the Card Payment increased because of the currency exchange rates when the reference exchange rate agreed with us has been applied, this will not be a valid reason.</li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>

The refund will include the entire amount of the Card Payment which will be dated back to the date on which your Account was debited.</li>
                        <li>You will not be entitled to a refund of any Card Payment that was initiated by or through payee when:
                            <ol>    
                                <li>you have given your consent to execute the Card Payment directly to us; and</li>
                                <li>where applicable, we or the payee has informed you about the upcoming Card Payment at least 4 weeks before it was due to be made.</li>
